    <p> From all the museums I visited throughout this trip, Museum of Literature (MoLI) was by far my favorite. Located across from St. Stephen’s Green, the Museum of Literature holds an extensive collection of ephemera belonging to Irish writers throughout the past two centuries. From Samuel Beckett to Bram Stoker, this exhibit is dedicated to the work of the country’s brightest and wisest. </p>
    <p> As you continue forward through the exhibit, you will find a room dedicated to this season’s exhibit on Irish Romance books throughout the decades. Feel free to pick up a book, but make sure to return it before the end of your visit! </p>
    <p> Walk to the next room and you’ll find the “Riverrun of Language” exhibit, where approaching one of the four tables, each dedicated to a prominent theme in Irish poetry, unlocks an immersive audio installation. Here, you can listen to audio recordings of poems and even take a post card of your favorite poem from the installation. </p>
    <p> In the next room, you can find a year-round exhibit dedicated to James Joyce and his depiction of Dublin throughout his work. In the middle of the room is a 3D map with marked points as to where moments in Joyce’s work take place. The walls of this room also provide more temporal information that relate back to the city of Dublin and its ever changing landscape. </p>
    <p> There’s even more that I could tell you about, but I think it’s worth stopping by yourself and checking it out the next time you’re in Dublin! By the end of the trip, you may find yourself having a coffee or hearty meal in their dining room, or even buying one of the many different copies of Ulysses available at the gift shop. </p>
