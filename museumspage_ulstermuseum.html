        <p> Last but not least, I was able to make it to the Ulster Museum during my last day in Belfast, and was not disappointed in the slightest. </p>
        <p> The museum has three different branches of interest: </p>
        <ol>
           <li>History</li>
           <li>Natural Sciences</li>
           <li>Art</li>
        </ol>
        <p> Given that I arrived an hour before closing, the Art branch along with the current exhibit on the Troubles were the two places I visited within this museum’s four floors of endless wonders. </p>
        <p> The exhibit on the Troubles had several material objects that belonged to different members of the IRA along with the army. You could even find posters from that time that addressed issues such as reporting suspicious behavior or remembering martyrs like Bobby Sands. </p>
        <p> What intrigued me the most about this installation was the table dedicated to providing your opinions and remarks regarding the exhibit. These then are processed and published on screen for future viewers to read. Some comments were on how well done the installation was while others remarked that they never really noticed these moments of violence while growing up in Belfast during the Troubles. All in all, this exhibit felt rooted in conversation and dialogue surrounding a rather controversial moment in Belfast history, but was open to critiques and feedback. </p>
        <p> If you find yourself in the Arts branch of the museum, you’ll find some traditional European paintings, but make sure to wander towards their current exhibit installation dedicated to Akhiko Okamura’s photography during the Troubles. Here are some of the rawest stills of human interaction, which left me quite moved. I hope to come across his work once again someday soon and further analyze these photographs through discussion and personal writings. </p>
