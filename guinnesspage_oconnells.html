                <p> After a thirty minute train ride that felt like nearly two hours, we finally arrived to Howth; a tiny village near the shore. The weather? Unbearable. Public restrooms? Three, but also clogged. So we made our way down their main street towards O’Connell’s where the smell of an active fireplace could be detected from minutes away. The bar was busy with different tables that seemed to all know each other. By this time in the day, I was very hungry so I chose a fish chowder to pair with my Guinness—and goodness, am I glad I did that. The chowder was splendid and really was the star of the pub. It came with fresh bread and butter which were both appropriately warm. The Guinness? Nice and cold to balance out the fresh, stomach warming food. This was quite a nice pub with a rather interesting crowd, so it evened out to a fairly good place. </p>
