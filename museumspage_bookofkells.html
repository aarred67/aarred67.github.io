        <p> This exhibit had the top priority on my list of places to see, and while the written portion of the exhibit was quite impressive, I was not incredibly satisfied. I should have believed my cab driver on the way to Trinity College—where the exhibit is located—that this would not entirely live up to any expectations I may have set for it. </p>
        <p> Seeing the physical book was quite amazing. The lighting was beautifully dimmed and the room was quiet even with a handful of people crowding the glass barrier that protected the book from our grimy hands and urge to flip the page. As you move upstairs, you enter one of the most beautiful book collection rooms, which is pictured above. </p>
        <p> The first two shelves are filled with books while the rest are empty. The guard working that hour shared with me that they were taken for cleaning and repairs, yet also added that the room was hard to work in with how much dust filled the space; an issue the museum rarely ever took care of. As much as I wanted to enjoy this exhibit, I left with more of a concern for the staff who work in that room as the guard had also noted that many other staff members were left with coughing conditions and disinclination to work in that particular room. Overall not a great takeaway when it came to this museum. </p>
        <p> In addition to this, they have a new building dedicated to the archives and collection of the museum which is all white and rather lifeless, watering down just how intricate special collections can be. Again, I am rather miffed by the whole place, but it’s worth going to and checking it out for yourself. </p>
