                <p> I’ve steadily decided that nothing can beat the Jeggy Nettle. What a place. This was suggested to us by our cab driver on our way to a one act play about a couple sending their last goodbyes to friends and families during the apocalypse—a metaphor for the COVID-19 pandemic, which became rather obvious once facetime was the only form of contact. Though a rather interesting play, the bar made this night the best one out of all my evenings in Ireland. </p>

                <p> Entering the pub, you’d have thought there were absolutely no seats available. Each table had a group of friends or lovers sitting across from each other, playing a game of cards or sharing stories accompanied by hearty laughs. As I did a quick lap around the pub, I was able to grab a table that was packed only a minute before. Better yet, it was located right next to a dying fire in the chimney… and directly in front of a live musician who oddly looked identical to Lou Reed. It was a beautiful setting with the best little spot to do some people watching while I enjoyed a Guinness. This will absolutely be my first spot I return to the next time I’m in Belfast! </p>
