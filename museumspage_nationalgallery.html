        <p> What a museum. I really was left slightly speechless at the collection housed here. In fact, I’d even say that some of New York’s own museums have a competition across the Atlantic. Also located near the park, the National Gallery has some of the most beautiful pieces I’ve ever seen. </p>
        <p> It was nice to see a Rodin sculpture different from the ones I typically gawk at when at the Metropolitan Museum. You can also find some beautiful portraits throughout, and even a room dedicated to landscapes. </p>
        <p> If you’re looking for a classic art museum, this is the place to go. You’ll find everything from paintings to textiles to sculpture within the many rooms that feel like a maze. And if that’s not enough to convince you to get lost in the gallery for an hour or two, it’s free! Truly a place full of incredible pieces and a wonderful layout. </p>
