                <p> We actually went to this pub for food! So no, we’re not just looking for our next pint wherever we go, but we did in fact have a pint here. I also really wanted to try steak and Guinness pie, and this place had a very delicious steak and Guinness pie. Loaded with gravy and mashed potatoes, the pie was perfectly done and had a bready crust that was incredible. The Guinness was not as memorable, but still quite good! I was satisfied. </p>

                <p> Pictured above is my incredible food from that night. This is also where I watched my first few rounds of horse racing… I never realized how many silly names for horses there could be. I am also very bad at guessing which horse will win. </p>
